  ## Description



The motivation behind this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts and create a friend list. The API has been created using Express JS for the routing, MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM.
  
       
  ### Functional Requirements

  The functional requirements that Social Network API has been designed to meet are defined by the user story and acceptance criteria listed below.  

  #### User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```
 

#### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```

  ## Installation
  
  After cloning the application follow the instructions below to install the application:

    
  Install dependencies:

       npm i
